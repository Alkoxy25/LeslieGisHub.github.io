## **Project I: KNUST FINAL YEAR PROJECT**

 **Purpose**  
This was a risk assessment done on soil,water amd crops at locations around tailings damsite at Abosso Goldfields Daamang. 
  
- **Figure 1**: Damang mine infrastructure at Abosso, showing the three locations where soil samples were collected.

## **Project II: Namdini Gold Project**

 **Role**  
Geotechnical consultancy and supervision of the construction of three dams during the infrastructure phase of the Namdini Gold Project.  

**GIS was incoporated in Geotechnical workflows and played a crucial part in the advancement and completion of the project**

 **Maps**  
Below are some maps created during the project:

##  **Project III Memphis Campus Project**

**The Aim of these workflows was to was optimize distanced travelled by a waste collection truck during its routine collection on Memphis University Campus at Tennesse in the United States of America**

**contact**

**The following are conclusions and results of several  real and possible scenarious of the waste collector truck using network analysis(route analysis in arcgispro)**

![layout_Scenario_1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d0b224c-7620-4092-960f-c3f8d10ff169)

![Layout_Scenario_3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed7dae92-3164-4184-a5f6-8f9691864fe0)
![Layout_Scenario_4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc54715a-24ac-4691-a02b-b0f779dab2d9)


From the different scenario analysis, scenario 2 has the optimized path to visit all 18 wastebins with the least distance travelled of 5.824 km
For efficiency in waste bin collection and with distance being optimized......Sequence of collection and route of Scenario 2 is encouraged to be used the Sanitation and waste collection team during their routine activities
