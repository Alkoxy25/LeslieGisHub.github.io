##  **Project III Memphis Campus Project**

**The Aim of these workflows was to was optimize distanced travelled by a waste collecction truck during its routine collection on Memphis University Campus at Tennesse in the United States of America**

**contact**

**The following are conclusions and results of several scenarious using network analysis(route analysis in arcgispro)**
