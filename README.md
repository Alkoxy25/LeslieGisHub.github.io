## **Project I: KNUST FINAL YEAR THESIS**

 **Purpose**  
This was a risk assessment done on soil,water amd crops at locations around tailings damsite at Abosso Goldfields Daamang.

## **Project II: Namdini Gold Project**

 **Role**  
Geotechnical consultancy and supervision of the construction of three dams during the infrastructure phase of the Namdini Gold Project.  

**GIS was incoporated in Geotechnical workflows and played a crucial part in the advancement and completion of the project**


Below are some maps created during the project:

##  **Project III Memphis Campus Project**

**The Aim of these workflows was to was optimize distanced travelled by a waste collection truck during its routine collection on Memphis University Campus at Tennesse in the United States of America**

**Reasearch colleague contact in USA:boatengpato.pb@gmail.com**

**These are the conclusions and results of several real and possible scenarious of the waste collector truck using network analysis(route analysis in arcgispro)**

Based on the scenario analysis conducted, Scenario 2 demonstrates the most optimized route(least travel distance comparing all scenarios) for waste collection, achieving a total distance of 5.824 km to service all 18 waste bins. This optimized path significantly enhances operational efficiency by minimizing travel distance.

To improve waste collection logistics, it is recommended that the Sanitation and Waste Collection Team adopt the sequence of collection and route from Scenario 2 during their routine operations. The GIS-based analysis underscores the importance of leveraging spatial optimization techniques to streamline waste management workflows, reduce fuel consumption, and improve service delivery.

Incorporating the optimized route into operational practices will ensure a data-driven approach to waste bin collection, fostering sustainable and cost-effective waste management.

## **Project IV: Tema Harbor Road ROAD Condition Survey**

**This project involved conducting a Road Condition Survey (RCS) on the Tema Harbour Dual Carriageway(Road), one of Ghanaâ€™s most vital transport corridors. The primary objective of the RCS was to systematically assess the physical condition of the road to support decision-making on maintenance, rehabilitation, or upgrade planning.**

As part of the survey, we evaluated surface defects such as cracks, potholes, rutting, edge failures, and drainage issues. The Tema Harbour Road serves as a key link between the port and inland destinations, and its condition has direct implications on freight efficiency, road safety, and overall economic productivity. The Duality of the carriageway seperated by a median demanded the survey be done in two parts the Rightside and then the Leftside.
The data collected was analyzed using Visual Condition Index(VCI) and other condition criteria as well as GIS tools to map deterioration patterns, prioritize sections needing urgent intervention, and support asset management planning for sustainable infrastructure development.

The Plan for Rehabilitation and Maintenance were as according to the degrree of damage on sections of the dual carriageway which was later developed as follows;

very good- no immediate maintenance required

good - minor maintenance needed

fair - preventive maintenance required

poor -major maintenance needed

very poor - complete reconstruction recommended
